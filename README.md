### ToDo's

- Make edges of page clickable for turning pages, etc
- Do not start a download if there is no internet connection
- Handle book download error
- Add refresh library menu item
- Progress bar on book download
- Before pushing live, make sure the cache policy on the reader files is right (or use a bust string). Also, handle scenario where they have no internet connection.

### Bugs

- toc data getting wiped on relaunch of app
- Bloodlines does not display
- Periodically, a book that normally displays does not display
- On some books, characters might be corrupted by android ajax hack
- first time I open the app, book images do not show
- I believe that internal links also cause page turns or middle tab (they shouldn't)
- I belive external links are not handled properly
